Product management
Blockchain has been hijacked early 
by cryptocurrency, which is a monetary 
application of the the technology, 
and misrepresented about it potential 
and scope of application. Blockchain 
technology has the potential to radical 
transform various aspects of social, 
economic and political spheres of life. 
It's unique qualities such as being 
fraud proof, immutability, confidentiality
and accessibility makes it viable 
solution to multiple challenges we 
are faced today. It's product managers 
responsibility to bring products that 
not only solve problems but radical 
changes the ways of life. A good 
product manager should exploit the 
advent of new technology and the 
appropriateness of time. A visionary 
product managers give us product such 
as google, Facebook, PayPal, eBay and 
Amazon by exploiting the advent of 
internet and advancement of software 
development. It's time for next 
generation product managers to see 
similar opportunities and realize 
transformative products. It's apparent 
great products are result of unreserved 
effort and hard work of great team. 
Great teams are built and optimized 
to it's full potential by inspiring 
and painting the picture of what's 
head and the great opportunities and 
mysteries the future holds. Successful 
product managers have the skills to 
mobilize and engage people to realize 
the next big product. Having a vision 
and means is not enough, assembling 
motivated team and building their 
capacity is instrumental to pioneer 
great products and maintain them. 
We are living in transection of time 
where technologies are crossing the 
boundaries into the realms of what was 
impossible. To bring such aspirations 
to fruition visionary product managers 
are critical to lead team to exploit 
such an opportunity to create a next 
generation product. Currently, I'm 
taking a class on product management 
from Aya web3 fellowship, and I hope 
I will learn useful skills, insights 
and experience.
